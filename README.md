# FlowersShopHibernate

## Motivation
This is a project I did for my Java programming course at IT School which involved using my basic knowledge of Java, MySQL and the Hidernate framework.

## Description

My project is a simple application for managing products, clients, and orders. It provides basic features, including adding products, managing clients, and placing orders.
For ease of use, the program automatically generates customers, orders and products using the Java Faker dependency. I also used the Scanner class to enter manually, from the keyboard, the number of customers and products to be generated automatically.
